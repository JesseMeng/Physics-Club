# Physics-Club
I was the leader at my high school's physics club, among a few other classmates. At the end of grade 11, we decided to aim to score top 5 in North America as a team in the AAPT physics bowl challenge,
an international competition written by 7500+ people each year, so that we could win T-shirts :D
We started planning for the following year's club meetings. We had numerous meetings each week. Moreover, we splitted up the topics 
among the leaders so each of us can instruct on the general club(I was responsible for mechanics and electricy&magnetism).
Throughout my club tutorial sessions, I created my own problemsets and quizzes for the club members and I made announcements and summaries for those who missed the session or those who are 
curious of the content we learned.
Finally, after we have discussed in detail every possible question from the past years' exams, and that we had a solid grasp of the physics knowledge required, our team scored 7th globally and 4th in North America. Moreover,
two of our candidates were tied the second place in Canada. Moreover, we won T-shirts!
This repository sums up the work I contributed to my high school's physics club. It was a memorable experience!
